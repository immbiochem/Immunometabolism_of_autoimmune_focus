# Immunometabolism_of_autoimmune_focus
The project is devoted to the analysis of the expression of metabolic genes of immune cells in the focus of inflammation in various autoimmune diseases

Analysis of transcriptome of immune cells from autoimmune foci of psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus.
The initial goal is to detect the presence or absence of increased expression of amino acid metabolism enzymes (especially tryptophan, arginine and glutamine) among immune cells.
